Open Source Hardware Project. I need help with my crowd-funding sales and data sheet. Of anyone would like to make edits or suggest changes it would be much appreciated.  I'm wondering about comprehension from someone who isn't living and breathing this project.  A video can be viewed at https://vimeo.com/51114924








What’s MoCo?

Over the past two years we’ve been busy working on the future of cinematic motion control (MoCo). Although motion control is nothing new, it has been a closely guarded Hollywood secret that only the big studios with their deep pocket books could afford, that is until now. At Motion Sickness we’re designing a low cost, open-source MoCo Rig, made with off-the-shelf components that you can easily get on the internet. We believe in giving a diy filmmaker the same tools to share his or her vision as a Hollywood insider. We believe open source is the future of not only MoCo but the way we innovate and share ideas. It’s time to give the art back to the people. It's time to change the game.
MoCo is nothing new.  In fact, Star Wars was the first film to use it.  Since then motion control software and hardware for the film industry has stayed extremely expensive. Last year a couple companies came out with “toy” MoCo systems.  These units are aimed at the DSLR video market, and are very proprietary.  Meaning a focus motor from “company A” won’t work with the software from “company b”.  We find this unacceptable and want to change things.


Give me more specs?

Our open-source MoCo Rig gives you pixel perfect, precision control of the motion picture camera. The compact system offers live-action, time-lapse and stop-motion.  It has control over the camera shutter and 4 axis including Dolly, Pan, Tilt & Focus. The system is expandable to eight axis though.  These extra channels can be used for roll, zoom, iris - or a turntable.  All axis are precisely controlled by Mantis II which is a Windows-based, video-specific motion control application.  Simply set your motor positions in a timeline with keyframes.  You can easily deleted or move keyframes to adjusted position or acceleration of the motors.  If feels very similar to keyframe editing in Adobe After Effects or Final Cut. 

Why are you better than the other guys?

Low, Low Price:  We are working hard to get the price as low as possible.  Here are the ballpark prices for the final MoCo rig; Parts: $5000 - Raw parts, Kit: $6500 - Pre-Cut Wiring and Some Assembly of certain components, Fully Assembled & Calibrated: $8000  - Ready to shoot!

Open Source Design:  All plans, including schematics, wiring diagrams, parts and price lists will be available for free at motionsick.org. We will be relying heavily on our users, to help us improve our MoCo Rig, and think of new and innovative ways to use and modify it.

Wireless XBOX™ Controller:  Full controller of the MoCo Rig. For programming and running moves, or performing manual moves. 

Stepper Motors:  High precision stepper motors with near-silent microstepping drives. 

Harmonic Drives:  Zero backlash, compact, light-weight, with high torque ratios. These are the most high-tech reduction gears on the market. These reducers give our Pan/Tilt Head over 10,240,000 million positions in one rotation, that’s a 0.000035 degree resolution. 

Nodal Point:  Our Pan/Tilt Head is large enough to handle a RED and most prime lenses - all while keeping camera movements true to the nodal center.

Hollow Pivot Points:  HDMI and the focus and shutter control wires pass directly through the center of the Pan/Tilt head.  This means the head can do multiple rotations in either direction without the wires getting tangled. 

Belt Placement: Our dolly drive belt runs through the center of the track. Other systems have the belt above the track - which means it can more easily end up in your shot. Pass!
Open Standards: Our system comes with pre-tested components.  However, most motion control components are from the manufacturing industry, and they are all interchangable.  This means you can chose from a large number of different options when it comes to things like motors, motor drives and power supplies. In fact: our first lens motor was made with a stepper motor from an old printer - it worked pretty good too!


Where is my cash money goin?

By funding this project you’re helping us finalize our 4 Axis MoCo Rig and launch motionsick.org.  As soon as we finish both we will post the schematics and parts lists online for free.  Here is a list of the things we are still working on. 

Harmonic Drives: These gear reducers will take 100 rotations from the motor shaft and output only 1. These small gearboxes mount directly to the stepper motors and will give us the high resolution that we need. According to "Mark Robert’s Motion Control" (THE Hollywood standard) zero backlash gearing accounts for 60 percent of the price of a motion control system. We are working hard to get that down but they are still very expensive compared to regular gearboxes.

Dolly and Track: We are going to be modifying our dolly to a more modular and expandable. The tracks will come in 4ft increments and the dolly truck will be made mostly from 15mm rods (industry standard) and clamping hardware. 

Electronics Housing:  We are working to make our electronics housing as small as possible while leaving room for expansion.

MotionSick.org:  A large portion of the funds raised will go to launch our website.  At motionsick.org you will find info on all the different components of a MoCo system as well as links to all the recommended products for each catagory.  A main part of motionsick.org will be the forum.  This will be the place where people can share news ideas and get help if they run into any problems.  

Extra Funds:  Will help us expand our operation, which includes the development of an open source MoCo crane.
